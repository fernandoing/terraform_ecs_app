# Terraform AWS Project

This project uses Terraform to provision and manage resources on AWS. The architecture of the project is broken down into modules for managing different resources like ECS, RDS, VPC, etc. for better organization and reusability.

## Project Directory Structure

- `main.tf` - The main entry point for Terraform, where all the modules are used.
- `variables.tf` - Contains the declarations for variables used throughout the project.
- `outputs.tf` - Contains the outputs of the deployed resources.
- `modules/` - A directory that contains all the Terraform modules used in the project. There are different modules for each type of resource, such as ECS, Apps, RDS, VPC, etc.

## Prerequisites

1. You'll need to have [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your local machine.
2. An [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start) is required. Make sure your AWS credentials are configured on your local machine, or use AWS roles and policies if you're running Terraform on an EC2 instance.
3. Make sure you have appropriate permissions to create and manage the AWS resources described in the Terraform configuration files.
4. Install and configure the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

2. Move into the project's root directory:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project
   ```

3. Initialize your Terraform workspace, which will download the provider plugins for AWS:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. Verify the changes that will occur in your workspace:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. If everything looks good, apply the changes to your workspace:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   You will be asked for a confirmation, type `yes` and hit enter.

6. To delete all the resources when you're done, use:

   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

## Accesing the Application


## Customizing the Deployment

If you wish to customize the deployment, such as changing the instance types, or the number of instances, edit the respective values in the `variables.tf` found in the root directory.

## Modules

The `modules/` directory contains the definitions for each resource to be created. The `main.tf` in the root directory calls these modules and passes necessary variables to them.

## Output

The `outputs.tf` file defines the values that will be returned after `terraform apply` is successfully executed. For example, you can output the IP address or URL of a server.

That's all! If you have any trouble or further inquiries, don't hesitate to ask.
